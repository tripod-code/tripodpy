Welcome to TripodPy's documentation!
====================================

| ``TripodPy`` is a Python package to simulate the evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks.

| This documentation is for ``TripodPy v1.0.0``.

| ``TripodPy`` simulates the radial evolution of gas and dust in protoplanetary disks, including viscous evolution of the gas, advection and diffusion of the dust, as well as dust growth by an the TriPoD Method.

| ``TriPoD`` algortihem has been published in `Pfeil et al. 2024 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A&A...691A..45P>`_.

| ``TripodPy`` requires a Python3 distribution and a Fortran compiler.

| ``TripodPy`` is based on the ``Simframe`` framework for scientific simulation (`Stammler & Birnstiel 2022 <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03882>`_).
| Please have a look at the `Simframe Documentation <https://simframe.rtfd.io/>`_ for details of its usage.
